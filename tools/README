Importing missing tiles from VeloViewer into EveryTile
------------------------------------------------------

You will need: sed and octave/matlab, both available for every linux distro

1) Get the KML file with yur missing tiles from your summary page on veloviewer.com,
   save as explorer2.kml 

2) run 
   sed "s#[^ ]\+ [^ ]\+ [^ ]\+ [^ <]\+</coordinates>#\n#g" explorer2.kml |sed "s/.*<coordinates>//" | sed "s/,/ /" | sed "s#</LineString>.*##">tiles.txt

   this collects the relevant data from explorer2.kml in a simple ascii file tiles.txt

3) Start octave (or matlab) and run 
   > tiles

   This creates (or overwrites!) a bmap.json file in your project's resources/jsonData folder

4) recompile your project. Copy bin/EveryTile.prg to your device into /Garmin/Apps/ and remove
   /Garmin/Apps/DAT/EveryTile.*
